Abstract = {As wildfires increase in frequency and severity, there is a growing interest in understanding river response to the wildfire disturbance cascade. Numerous headwater mountain catchments within the Cache la Poudre (Poudre) River basin in the Colorado Front Range, USA burned severely and extensively during the 2020 Cameron Peak fire. Debris flows and flash floods occurred in many of these catchments triggered by convective storms after the fire. The downstream effects of the floods and sediment varied along a continuum from attenuated and largely contained within the catchment, to releasing substantial volumes of water and sediment to the Poudre River. We conceptualize these catchments as exhibiting decreasing absorbance of post-fire disturbance along the continuum described above based on the geomorphic evidence of relative sediment export. We conceptualize characteristics on different spatial scales as driving or resisting response to disturbance and therefore impacting the absorbing c},

abstract = {Summary
Alpine catchments are important sources of fresh water but compared to lower altitude catchments our understanding of the hydrological functioning of these catchments during rainfall and snowmelt events is still limited. The objectives of this study were i) to identify the dominant runoff generation mechanisms in the 0.14-km2 Bridge Creek Catchment in the Italian Dolomites during nine rainfall–runoff events and six snowmelt–runoff events in spring, summer and autumn of 2010–2012; and ii) to assess the effect of the selection of the pre-event water sample on the isotope hydrograph separation results. The isotopic composition of the pre-event water was determined by either a stream water sample taken prior to the event or the average of 19 stream water samples taken during baseflow conditions. The hydrograph separation results for the two methods were very similar for the rainfall events but differed for the snowmelt events. Average event water contributions ranged between 4% and 19% or 2% and 20% of the total runoff during rainfall events, and between 7% and 25% or 9% and 38% during snowmelt events, depending on the method used to determine the isotopic composition of pre-event water. Event water contributions were important during large rainfall events, intense rainfall events and late in the snowmelt season, with maximum event water contributions up to 37% and 46%, depending on the method used for determining the pre-event water composition. The electrical conductivity of stream water tended to first decrease and reach a minimum before peak streamflow and then to increase above pre-event values. The results of this study suggest that during dry conditions, direct channel precipitation and overland flow from the permanently saturated part of the riparian zone dominated the runoff response, with limited contributions of riparian or hillslope groundwater. During wet or very wet conditions (large rainfall events or peak snowmelt), saturation overland flow increased due to the expansion of the saturated areas and riparian groundwater and hillslope subsurface flow to streamflow increased as well. On the one hand, this work contributes to a better understanding of runoff generation processes in mountain headwater catchments where rainfall and snowmelt events dominate the hydrological response. On the other hand, this study highlights the sensitivity of the two-component hydrograph separation technique to the selection of the pre-event water sample for snowmelt events. This calls for further studies in snow-dominated catchments to determine the consistency of the isotopic composition of stream water prior to individual snowmelt events and to assess whether the individual melt events during the melt season should be considered part of a single long snowmelt event.}

Abstract = {Previous studies have shown limited success in improving streamflow forecasting for snow-dominated watersheds using physically based models, primarily due to the lack of reliable snow water equivalent (SWE) information. Here we use a hindcasting approach to evaluate the potential benefit that a high-resolution, spatiotemporally continuous, and accurate SWE reanalysis product would have on the seasonal streamflow forecast in the snow-dominated Sierra Nevada mountains of California if such an SWE product were available in real time. We tested the efficacy of a physically based ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) framework when initialized with the reanalysis SWE. We reinitialized the SWE over the Sierra Nevada at the time when the Sierra Nevada had domain-wide annual maximum SWE for each year in 1985–2015, and on 1 February of the driest years within the same period. The early season forecasts on 1 February provide valuable lead time for mitigating the impact of drought. In both experi},
